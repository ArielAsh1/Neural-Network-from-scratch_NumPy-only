# Neural Network (MLP) from scratch using numpy

Implementing and training a Neural Network (multi-layer perceptron) from scratch using only numpy, to identify handwritten digits (MNIST dataset).

Without Tensorflow/Pytorch libraries.

The network takes an image and predicts the digit that's in it.
